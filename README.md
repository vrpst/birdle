# birdle
A simple clone(ish) of Wordle in a bash script.

To install, `chmod +x` the `install.sh` script — this will add the files to your `~/.local/bin` folder; if you add this to PATH, you will be able to run the command `birdle` to launch the game.

To uninstall, `chmod +x uninstall.sh` and run it to remove the files.
